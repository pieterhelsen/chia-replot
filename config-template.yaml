  # The threshold, in number of plots that you want to maintain.
  # This utility will monitor the size of EACH disk and delete
  # the oldest plots until the threshold is maintained.
  # Note: minimum value is 2 plots
  threshold: 2

  # The date prior to which you wish to delete plots.
  # Since there is no easy way to distinguish poolable plots from
  # single plots, we use the date.
  #
  # This tool will compare the date in the plot FILENAME to this date
  # in order to determine which plots to remove

  # The mode in which you want this tool to delete plots.
  # Available modes are:
  # - consecutive: will entirely clear the first path before moving to the next
  # - iterative: will rotate between paths on each run
  mode: consecutive

  # The interval, in minutes at which this tool will monitor
  # your drives and delete plots if necessary
  interval: 5

  # When set to true, this will only simulate plot removal
